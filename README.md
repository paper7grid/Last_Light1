​Hello!! This is my first 3D game I built using Godot software and it is a horror 3D game. The setting of the house is that: You are kidnapped and are left clues to escape out of the house. The killer has set a trap with a few clues around the house in the form of notes. If you are smart enough to solve his riddles and escape within 15 minutes you are truly a survivor. BUT if the time is up and you were not able to solve them, then you die, the killer kills you. 

Some of the controls: 

F- Flashlight

P - to pause/unpause the game

E - to interact (pickup or open door) 

Arrow keys and mouse to look around/ move. 

Have fun playing the game!! 
You can play it on itch.io:
